        Recursion :

        * A function which call itself again and again.
        * ex :
                void func(){

                        func();
                }
        * Base Condition is Must in Recursion to avoid the 'StackOverflowError'.
	* Tail Recursion is More Optimized than Non-Tail Recursion.
        * Their are Two Types of Recursion :

                1) Tail Recursion -
